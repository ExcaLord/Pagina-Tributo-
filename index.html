            <h2>Past.</h2>
            <p id="born">Luffy was born in <strong>Foosha Village</strong> to <strong>Monkey D. Dragon</strong> and an unknown woman. 
                Dragon left Luffy in the care of his grandfather, <strong>Monkey D. Garp</strong>, who did many
                dangerous things to Luffy to make him stronger, like throwing him down a deep ravine, leaving him alone in the wild, 
                and tying him to a balloon </p>
                <h3>Shanks And Luffy.</h3>
                <p id="luffyAndShanks">When Luffy was 6, <strong>Shanks</strong> and the <strong>Red Hair Pirates</strong> stationed themselves in Foosha Village.
                    While they were there, their <i>sniper</i> <strong>Yasopp</strong> frequently told Luffy that he had a <strong>son</strong> his age named <strong>Usopp</strong>.
                    Luffy wanted to join the Red Hair Pirates, and after they had been in the village for nearly a year,
                    he stabbed himself under his left eye to prove he was tough enough to be a pirate</p>
                <h3>Luffy's New Family: Bandits and Brothers.</h3>
                <p id="brothers">After the Red Hair Pirates left, Garp took Luffy to <strong>Mt. Colubo</strong> and placed him in the care of the mountain bandit 
                    <strong>Curly Dadan</strong> and the <i>Dadan Family</i>. He introduced Luffy to Dadan's other ward <strong>Portgas D. Ace</strong>, but Ace was <i>cold</i> toward Luffy.
                    Every day, Ace would travel away from the Dadan Family hideout, and Luffy <i>attempted to follow him</i>. Ace would put obstacles in his path to stop him, but Luffy continued following him. 
                    Eventually, Luffy made it to <strong>Gray Terminal</strong>, where he found Ace <i>counting</i> <strong>money</strong> with a boy named <strong>Sabo</strong>. When Luffy went up to them,
                    Ace and Sabo captured him and talked about killing him to keep their secret safe. Porchemy of the Bluejam Pirates then came walking through the woods,
                    and as Ace and Sabo hid from him, they left Luffy to be captured. Porchemy took Luffy to his base and interrogated him about the money Ace and Sabo
                    had stolen from his crew. Luffy refused to answer him, even when Porchemy nearly beat him to death with spiked gloves. Ace and Sabo then came to the base and
                    freed Luffy, with Ace beating Porchemy.</p>
